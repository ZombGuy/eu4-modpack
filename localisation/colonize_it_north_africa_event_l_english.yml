 colonize_it_flavor_north_africa.2.d: "Fez is an ancient city where many Muslim dynasties had their capitals. The intricate streets are like a maze. However, there is no land left in the city that can be used as a colonial base."
 colonize_it_flavor_north_africa.2.1.n: "We'll use this town as a base! There's some land next door, right?"

 colonize_it_flavor_north_africa.4.d: "\"Once upon a time, in the Mali Empire in West Africa, there was a king named Mansa Musa. He headed for Mecca with tens of thousands of retainers and over 10 tons of gold donated to the surrounding area to make the pilgrimage. This caused the price of gold to plummet in Cairo, the transit point. But in the end, they didn't have enough gold, so they borrowed money, hahaha!\"\nI don't know if this is true, but is there such a thing as a crazy person? The merchants in Fez laughed at this story. The merchant continued\n\"I don't know if it's true, it's just a legend. I don't know if it's true. Ten tons of gold...\"\nIs it just a legend, or did it really happen, and can one king bring inflation to Egypt? The more I think about it, the more it smells fishy, but it is a very well told story."

 colonize_it_flavor_north_africa.5.d: "In order to get to India, you have to go around Africa and make a big detour before getting to India. But what if we can hold off Egypt? Through the calm Mediterranean Sea and into the Red Sea, India is just around the corner. The main problem, however, is that the two countries are connected by land, so a waterway would have to be built. This will require a lot of money."
 colonize_it_flavor_north_africa.5.1.n: "Egyptian expedition!"
 colonize_it_flavor_north_africa.5.2.n: "The mainland is going to smell fishy when we go to Egypt."

 colonize_it_flavor_north_africa.6.2.n: "Cost reduction. No need for a fortress."
 colonize_it_flavor_north_africa.6.3.n: "We can't lose to Africa."
 colonize_it_flavor_north_africa.6.d: "We bought a map from a merchant and set out to find the golden land of West Africa in earnest. Should we start by establishing an outpost in [1127.GetName], not far from Morocco?"
